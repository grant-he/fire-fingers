# Fire Fingers
*A speed-focused typing game for competitors on the go.*

#### Details
Akin to the online browser-based typing game [*TypeRacer*](https://play.typeracer.com/). The main feature of the game is that players are given a matching prompt which they must correctly type as fast as they can. The player who completes the prompt fastest is considered the winner. As you race, your words per minute will be recorded, allowing you to track your typing speed over time.

Available on iOS 13.5+.

#### Special Instructions
- Open the file Fire Fingers.xcworkspace (as opposed to the file Fire Fingers.xcodeprog).
- Use an iPhone 11 Pro Max for the optimal experience.
- Application only works for portrait mode.
- To test lobbies/games with multiple players, build and run the application for different simulators simultaneously.
- Note that haptic feedback does not work for simulators.
- Enjoy! üèéÔ∏è üèéÔ∏è
