# Fire Fingers
A speed-focused typing game for competitors on the go. Akin to the onlie browser-based typing game *TypeRacer*.
The main feature of the game is that players are given a matching prompt which they must correctly type as fast
as they can. The player who completes the prompt fastest is considered the winner. As you race, your words per minute
will be recorded, allowing you to track your typing speed over time.


Available only on iOS (13.5)


Made by Grant He and Garrett Egan for Assistant Professor William Bulko's Summer 2020 CS 371L final project at UT Austin.
